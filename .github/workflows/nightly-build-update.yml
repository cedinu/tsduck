#  GitHub Actions configuration file : Nightly builds update
#
#  This workflow is supposed to be temporary. It is a workaround for a
#  problem with the GitHub Actions API (beta). The "nightly build" workflow
#  runs every night at 01:10 GMT. It builds Windows installers, uploads them
#  as artifacts and triggers an action on tsduck.io. This trigger calls the
#  GitHub Actions API to retrieve and download the artifacts (the installers).
#  However, the artifacts are made available to the API only when the workflow
#  completes, not when the upload-artifact steps completes. Since the trigger
#  is activated in the last step of the workflow (hence before it completes),
#  the artifacts are never found by tsduck.io. The present workflow runs
#  three hours after "nightly build". We expect the artifacts to be available
#  at that time.
